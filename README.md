# EMRA-Net
This is a demo of our paper: **An Ensemble Multi-scale Residual Attention Network (EMRA-Net) for Image Dehazing**.

## Main Prerequisites

- Python = 3.7.4
- Pytorch = 1.6.0
- Torchvision = 0.2.2
- Pillow = 7.2.0

## Run Demo

- We have put a pretrained model in the `model` directory.
- Before running the demo, you need to install the [Pytorch Wavelet](https://github.com/fbcotter/pytorch_wavelets) package, please see the related documentation for more detailed information.

- We have put some hazy images in the `test` directory (you can also put your own  images), and then  run the `test.py` file.  The dehazed images will be produced in the `result` directory ( it will be  created automatically ).
- Good Luck.
